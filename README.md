<h1 align="center" >Legality and correct use.</h1>

<p>1. Purpose and Legal Scope

AutoPayloadGen is a tool designed for the automated generation of payloads for legitimate cybersecurity purposes: authorized penetration testing, red team exercises, incident response, and training. The existence of the tool does not legitimize unauthorized use; full responsibility lies solely with the end user.

2. Core Legal Principle

Owning or distributing a security tool is not inherently illegal. What determines legality is how and against whom it is used: accessing, modifying, or damaging systems without authorization is often a criminal offense. Using AutoPayloadGen outside of contractual and authorized contexts may result in both criminal and civil liability.

3. Mandatory Rules for Legal Use of AutoPayloadGen

Prior written authorization from the system owner or administrator. Without it, use is prohibited.

Clearly defined scope: list targets, testing windows, permitted techniques, and limitations.

Contract (SoW / Authorization Letter) including scope, indemnity, handling of sensitive data, and reporting obligations.

Comprehensive logging of all actions performed by the tool.

Notification and coordination with system owners and emergency contacts to stop testing if needed.

Compliance with data protection laws when handling personal or sensitive information.

Explicit prohibition of malicious use (extortion, selling access, unauthorized disclosure, intentional damage).

4. Legal Risks (Summary)

Unauthorized access: criminal and civil penalties for accessing systems without permission.

Third-party damages: liability if the tool causes downtime, loss, or alteration of data.

Export controls / dual-use regulations: in some jurisdictions, distributing offensive tools is restricted.

Breach of contracts / Terms of Service: running the tool against prohibited services may result in contractual liability.

5. Minimum Contractual Requirements (SoW / Authorization Letter)

Every SoW or Authorization Letter should include at least:

Full identification of the parties.

Purpose: “Limited and temporary authorization to run tests using AutoPayloadGen on the listed assets.”

Dates and testing windows.

Permitted and prohibited techniques (e.g., forbid DoS, real data exfiltration, or pivoting without explicit permission).

Emergency contacts and procedures to halt tests.

Deliverables: vulnerability report, limited evidence, remediation plan.

Confidentiality clause and data handling provisions.

Liability limitations as allowed by law.

Signatures of authorized representatives.

6. Short Disclaimer for UI / Installer

AutoPayloadGen may only be used with written authorization from the system owner. The user is solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The developer assumes no liability for misuse. Unauthorized activity is strictly prohibited and may result in civil and criminal penalties.

This disclaimer should appear and require acceptance before installation/execution.

7. Compliance and Operational Checklist

Maintain signed authorization records.

Generate immutable forensic logs of all executions.

Avoid storing raw personal data; if collected, protect and delete according to law.

Use isolated environments and staging systems whenever possible.

Implement safety controls by default: safe mode, impact limits, kill-switch.

Review and approve payloads before deployment.

Define and follow a responsible disclosure process for discovered vulnerabilities.

8. Documentation Requirements (Priority Order)

Terms of Use / EULA.

Privacy Policy (if the tool collects or processes data).

Authorization Letter / SoW template.

Compliance guide per target jurisdiction.

Changelog and security notes.

9. EULA / Legal Disclaimer (Model Text)

EULA — Legal Summary

AutoPayloadGen is provided “as is” and only for legitimate cybersecurity purposes.

Unauthorized use without the express written consent of the system owner is strictly prohibited.

The user assumes full civil and criminal responsibility for the use of the tool.

The developer reserves the right to cooperate with authorities if legally required and does not endorse illegal activities.

The user agrees to indemnify and hold the developer harmless from claims arising from misuse, except in cases of proven gross negligence.

10. Brief Authorization Letter Template (Fields)

Client / organization name.

List of authorized assets (IPs, domains, systems).

Dates and testing windows.

Permitted / prohibited techniques.

Emergency contact details.

Signature and date.

11. Final Operational Recommendations

Never run AutoPayloadGen against production systems without written authorization and preparation.

Automate authorization checks: require upload of a signed letter before remote payload execution.

Enforce safe defaults: throttling, no destructive payloads unless explicitly confirmed.

Log everything: logs are your best legal defense if things go wrong.

Train operators on compliance and privacy.

Consult a lawyer before distributing or commercializing the tool internationally.</p>
